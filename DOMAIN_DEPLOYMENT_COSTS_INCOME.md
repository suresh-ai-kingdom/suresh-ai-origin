## 🧮 BUDGET → TARGET INCOME (Using your current dashboard data)

**Current metrics (screenshot):** 286 customers, ₹258,214 monthly revenue, ₹903 avg tier price, 17.8% upgrade rate.  
**Assumptions:** Average CPC ₹20-80 (Google/Facebook mix), landing-to-paid conversion 2.5-3.5%, CAC ~₹800-₹1,500.

| Target MRR | New customers needed (₹903 ARPU) | Ad CAC range | Estimated Ad Budget | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| Maintain ₹2.6L (offset churn) | 15-25/month | ₹800-₹1,200 | ₹12K-₹30K/month | Covers churn + small growth |
| ₹5L/month | ~270 new customers | ₹800-₹1,500 | ₹2.1L-₹4.0L (one-time push) | Split 60% Google, 40% Meta; expect 4-8 weeks |
| ₹10L/month | ~820 new customers | ₹800-₹1,500 | ₹6.5L-₹12.3L (phased 2-3 months) | Stagger spend; tighten targeting after week 1 |

**Channel split (recommended):**
- Google Search/Performance Max: 60% of budget (high intent)
- Meta (FB/IG): 30% (retarget + lookalike)
- LinkedIn (B2B only): 10% (if ACV > ₹10K/mo)

**Efficiency levers:**
- Raise on-site conversion from 3% → 5% with better CTA and testimonials (cuts CAC by ~40%).
- Use retargeting (10% of spend) to recover abandoned visitors (reduces CAC by 15-25%).
- Run upgrade nudges in-product to capitalize on 17.8% upgrade rate (no ad cost, boosts ARPU).
- Email flows for trials → paid: improves paid conversion by 20-30% at near-zero cost.

**Domain/infra cost remains tiny:** ~₹6,600/year all-in (domain + Render entry tier) compared to ad spend.

Use this table to decide monthly ad budget based on the MRR goal you want to hit.

### 🔍 If you spend ₹25K-₹30K this month (direct ads after buying domain)

**Assumptions:**
- CPC blended: ₹25-60 (Google + Meta mix)
- Landing→Paid conversion: 2.5-3.5%
- CAC expected: ₹900-₹1,400 (with retargeting enabled)
- Current ARPU: ₹903 (from dashboard)
- Upgrade rate: 17.8% (drives ARPU up over 30-60 days)

**Projected outcomes (Month 1):**
- Clicks: ~500-1,200
- New paying customers: ~35-55
- New MRR: ~₹30K-₹55K in Month 1
- Payback period: 1.5-2.5 months (improves if you lift conversion to 4-5%)

**Month 2 uplift (from upgrades + retained users):**
- Upgrades push ARPU toward ₹1,050-₹1,200
- Same cohort lifts to ₹35K-₹65K MRR without extra ad spend (if churn kept <5%)

**How to maximize with ₹25-30K:**
1) Allocate ₹15-18K to Google high-intent keywords (10-20 keywords; exact/phrase match).  
2) Allocate ₹7-9K to Meta retargeting + lookalike (3% LAL on converters).  
3) Allocate ₹2-3K to LinkedIn only if your ACV > ₹10K/month; otherwise skip and add to Google.  
4) Add onsite CTA tweaks (test 2 headlines, 2 CTAs) to push conversion toward 4-5% (cuts CAC to ₹600-₹900).  
5) Enable email drip for trial users (3 emails in 7 days) — usually adds +20-30% more conversions at near-zero cost.  

**Time to see results:**
- First conversions: Day 1-3 (Google), Day 3-5 (Meta retargeting) once pixel/GA data flows.  
- Stable CAC: By Day 7-10 after pausing poor keywords/creatives.  
- Payback: Typically inside 30-60 days given ₹903 ARPU and upgrades.
