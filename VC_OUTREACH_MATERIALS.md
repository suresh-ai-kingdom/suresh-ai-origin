I'm raising a $10M Series A for Suresh AI Origin, and I believe [VC Firm] would be an ideal partner given your focus on [specific thesis].

THE OPPORTUNITY:
• 135+ integrated AI systems (quantum, neural, blockchain, AGI)

• Top 0.0001% globally (1 in 1,000,000 platforms)
• $1.2M Year 1 ARR → $97.3M Year 5 (248% CAGR)

THE TRACTION:
• Complete platform operational (135+ systems)
• AWS multi-region infrastructure deployed
• IP portfolio: 4 patents filed + 2 trademarks
• Series A materials ready (deck, financials, cap table)

THE RAISE:
• Amount: $10M at $50M valuation

• Timeline: Close Q1/Q2 2026

THE MARKET:
• TAM: $500B+ (Enterprise AI + SaaS + Quantum + Web3)
• Unlike single-domain AI companies, we combine Google DeepMind + OpenAI + NASA capabilities into ONE platform

NEXT STEPS:

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: Warm Introduction

**Subject:** [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out - Series A raise

```
Hi [Partner Name],

[Mutual Connection Name] suggested I reach out about our Series A fundraising for Suresh AI Origin.

QUICK CONTEXT:
I built a 135+ system AI platform in 15 weeks that combines capabilities from Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and NASA into one unified platform.

KEY STATS:
• Top 0.0001% globally (1 in 1,000,000)
• 80,000+ LOC production code
• $1.2M → $97.3M ARR trajectory (5 years)
• Series A: $10M at $50M valuation

[Mutual Connection] thought this would align with [VC Firm]'s focus on [specific thesis], especially given [recent portfolio company or investment thesis].

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:
Most AI companies focus on 1-2 capabilities. We integrated 135+ systems across quantum computing, neural interfaces, blockchain, metaverse, AGI, and more. It's the complete enterprise AI stack.

Would love 30 minutes to discuss. I can share:
• Pitch deck (20 slides)
• Product demo
• Financial model
• Customer pipeline

Are you available this week or next?

Thanks,
Suresh

P.S. [Mutual Connection] mentioned you're interested in [specific topic]. Our platform addresses this directly with [specific feature].
