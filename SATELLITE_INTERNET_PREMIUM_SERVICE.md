        # Get usage data
        daily_usage = customer_data['daily_bandwidth']
        peak_hours = customer_data['peak_usage_times']
        applications = customer_data['applications_used']
        
        # AI analysis using Gemini
        prompt = f"""
        Analyze this satellite internet usage:
        Daily bandwidth: {daily_usage}
        Peak hours: {peak_hours}
        Applications: {applications}
        
        Recommend:
        1. Optimal data plan
        2. Cost savings opportunities
        3. Network optimizations
        4. Best provider (Starlink/Jio/OneWeb)
        """
        
        recommendations = ai.generate(prompt)
        
        return {
            'current_cost': calculate_current_cost(customer_data),
            'recommended_plan': recommendations['optimal_plan'],
            'potential_savings': recommendations['savings'],
            'provider_recommendation': recommendations['best_provider']
        }
    
    def auto_failover(self, primary_status, backup_status):
        """Automatically switch to satellite if fiber fails"""
        
        if primary_status == 'DOWN':
            # Switch to satellite backup
            switch_to_satellite()
            send_alert('Switched to satellite backup')
            log_downtime(primary_status)
        
        if primary_status == 'UP' and backup_status == 'ACTIVE':
            # Switch back to primary
            switch_to_primary()
            send_alert('Back to primary connection')
    
    def predict_costs(self, historical_data):
        """Predict next month's satellite data costs"""
        
        # Use AI to predict usage trends
        prompt = f"""
        Based on this usage history: {historical_data}
        Predict next month's bandwidth needs and costs.
        """
        
        prediction = ai.generate(prompt)
        
        return {
            'predicted_bandwidth': prediction['bandwidth'],
            'predicted_cost': prediction['cost'],
