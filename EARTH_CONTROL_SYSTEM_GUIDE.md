```

### Decision-Making Process:

```
Action Requested
    ↓
1. Check Tier 1 Rules (Human life, Environment, Safety)
    ↓ BLOCKED if violated
2. Check Tier 2 Rules (System integrity, Stability)
    ↓ BLOCKED if violated
3. Check Tier 3 Rules (Procedures, Protocols)
    ↓ BLOCKED if violated
4. Check Safety Score (must be >= 60/100)
    ↓ BLOCKED if violated
5. Execute Action
    ↓
6. Log Decision (permanent audit trail)
    ↓
7. Monitor Outcome

## 🌟 What Makes This Safe-First

### Unlike Traditional Systems:

**Traditional Approach:**
- Profit > Safety
- Efficiency > Stability
- Performance > Human protection
- Flexible rules that can be changed
- Reactive emergency response

**Earth Control System Approach:**
- SAFETY FIRST - always
- Stability > Efficiency
- Human protection > Performance
- RIGID, UNCHANGEABLE safety rules
- Proactive emergency prevention

### Safety Principles:

```
The system follows 3 unbreakable laws:

Law 1: A system must protect human life
       above all else

Law 2: A system must protect the environment
       from harm

Law 3: A system must prioritize safety
       over profit, efficiency, or any other goal

These laws CANNOT be overridden, suspended, or changed.
