## ✅ TASK 4: PERSONALIZE EMAIL #1 (45 min)

### Template (from FIRST_CUSTOMER_EMAILS.md):

**Subject:** Tired of paying for 20 different tools? 🤯

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're using [Tool A] + [Tool B] + [Tool C] to run [their business].

Quick question: How much are you paying per month for all your software? ₹50k? ₹1 lakh?

What if you could replace ALL of them with one platform for ₹9,999/month?

I just launched SURESH AI ORIGIN — 48 AI systems in one dashboard:

✅ Chatbot (replace Intercom)
✅ Analytics (replace Segment)
✅ Email automation (replace Mailchimp)
✅ A/B testing (replace Optimizely)
...and 44 more.

**Save ₹15 lakh/year.**

14-day free trial: https://sureshaiorigin.com

Use code **LAUNCH50** for 50% off first month (launching on Product Hunt tomorrow!)

Let me know if you have questions!

Best,
Suresh
