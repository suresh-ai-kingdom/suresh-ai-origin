## V2.6 ULTRA-RARE SERVICES (The 1%)

### 1. 🧠 NEURAL FUSION ENGINE (8 Services)

#### 1.1 Emotional AI - Deep Customer Emotion Analysis

**What it does:** Analyzes customer emotions in 8 dimensions, not just sentiment.

**8 Emotion Dimensions:**
- Joy (happiness, satisfaction)
- Trust (confidence, reliability)
- Fear (concerns, anxieties)
- Surprise (novelty, unexpected)
- Sadness (disappointment, loss)
- Disgust (repulsion, negativity)
- Anger (frustration, tension)
- Anticipation (excitement, expectation)

**Use Cases:**
- Detect when customers are about to churn (fear/disgust spike)
- Optimize messaging to resonate emotionally
- Predict which products will delight (joy/anticipation alignment)
- Identify angry customers before complaints
- Track emotional journey through customer lifecycle

**Example Request:**
```bash
POST /api/neural/emotional-ai
{
  "interaction_data": {
    "customer_feedback": "The product is okay but too expensive",
    "support_tickets": 3,
    "previous_interactions": [...]
  }
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "emotional_analysis": {
    "joy_score": 45,
    "trust_score": 65,
    "fear_score": 72,
    "surprise_score": 30,

#### 1.2 Probability Field Engine - See ALL Possible Futures

**What it does:** Instead of predicting ONE future, calculates the PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION of all possible outcomes.

**Calculates:**
- Full distribution of all outcomes
- Expected value (EV)
- Variance & standard deviation
- Best case, worst case, most likely case
- 95% confidence interval
- Value at Risk (VaR)

**Why it matters:** Traditional AI predicts "50% chance of success." Probability Field shows you the ENTIRE distribution - 10% catastrophic loss, 30% modest gain, 50% good outcome, 10% exceptional outcome.

**Use Cases:**
- Investment decisions with full risk picture
- Product launch scenarios (not just success/fail)
- Pricing decisions with confidence intervals
- Market entry decisions with complete outcome mapping

**Example Request:**
```bash
POST /api/neural/probability-field
{
  "scenario": {
    "market_size": 1000000,
    "product_price": 99,
    "target_conversion": 0.05,

```bash
# Step 1: Predict when customer will churn
POST /api/rare/longevity-predictor
{
  "customer_data": {
    "customer_id": "acme_corp",
    "engagement_trend": [100, 95, 85, 72, 58],
    "nps": 30
  }
}

# Response shows they'll churn in 60 days

# Step 2: Analyze their emotional state
POST /api/neural/emotional-ai
{
  "interaction_data": {
    "customer_feedback": "Your support is slow, pricing is high"
  }
}

# Response shows HIGH fear, HIGH anger

# Step 3: Optimize retention deal
POST /api/rare/deal-optimizer
{
  "list_price": 500,
  "customer_profile": {
    "budget": 400,
    "decision_speed_days": 7
  }
}

# Response recommends 30% discount + quarterly billing

# RESULT: Saved customer with surgical intervention
