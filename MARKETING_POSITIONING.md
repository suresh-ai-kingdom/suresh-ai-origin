# SURESH AI ORIGIN — Product Positioning Brief

## The Problem
**Attribution modeling in enterprise marketing is broken.**
- Complex tools require PhD-level analytics knowledge
- Platforms are designed for agencies, not in-house teams
- Even with correct attribution, there's no playbook to act on it
- Companies miss revenue opportunities and waste budgets on dead channels

## Our Solution
**SURESH AI ORIGIN: Attribution + Automation + ROI-First Playbook**

A purpose-built platform that:
1. **Clarifies attribution** — AI-powered multi-touch modeling that doesn't require a stats degree
2. **Automates action** — Convert insights into workflows (reallocate budgets, adjust bids, trigger campaigns)
3. **Proves ROI** — Built-in playbooks for high-converting channels and messaging frameworks
