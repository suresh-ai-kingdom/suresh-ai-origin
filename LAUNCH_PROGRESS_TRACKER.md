## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Domain Not Connecting (Friday 3 PM)
```
Option 1: Check DNS propagation (takes 30 min - 2 hours)
  - godaddy.com → manage domain
  - Verify nameservers match Render
  - Wait and test again in 15 min

Option 2: Contact Render support
  - They usually respond within 30 min
  - Have domain name ready
  - Provide error message

Workaround: Use Render's default domain until DNS updates
```

### If Razorpay Webhook Not Working (Friday 4 PM)
```
Steps:
  1. Verify webhook URL in Razorpay dashboard
  2. Check URL has https:// prefix
  3. Test webhook signature verification
  4. Make test payment
  5. Check Razorpay event logs
  6. If fails: Check webhook secret is correct in .env

Contact: Message Razorpay support (24/7)
```

### If Ads Not Getting Impressions (Friday 6 PM)
```
Common Causes:
  1. Ad approval pending (Google: 2-6 hours, Facebook: 15 min)
  2. Audience too narrow - expand keywords/audiences
  3. Budget too low for your bidding strategy
  4. Ad creative violates policy - edit and resubmit

Solutions:
  1. Wait for ad approval
  2. Increase budget to ₹2,000/day temporarily
  3. Add more keywords (aim for 50+)
  4. Create new ad variations
```

### If No Sales by Friday 9 PM
```
This is NORMAL - ads need time to:
  1. Get approved (2-6 hours)
  2. Build initial data (4-8 hours)
  3. Optimize (12-24 hours)

Action: Don't panic!
  - Weekend will show real traction
  - Saturday/Sunday is typically better
  - Monitor carefully but don't make hasty changes
