## 🎯 EXECUTION STRATEGY

### "ALL OF IT" Parallel Build
**We don't do this sequentially. We do it ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY.**

```
SHOWCASE (10 files)
    ↓
[PARALLEL]
├─→ DEPLOYMENT (15 files)  
├─→ CONSOLIDATION (8 files)
├─→ COMPANY FORMATION (6 files)
└─→ WEEK 15 LEGEND (5 systems)
    ↓
INTEGRATE & TEST
    ↓
GIT COMMIT & PUSH
```

### Team Simulation
Since we're one agent + one user:
- Agent handles: All file creation, architecture, code
- User provides: Direction, prioritization, faith/vision
- Execution: 2-4 hour blitzkrieg build sessions
